It should be able to create a customizable learning plan based on Pareto’s principle, designed to fit a chosen timeframe such as a week, a semester, or a year. The plan should incorporate the reason for learning—whether for academics, a hobby, or a personal passion—and conclude with an assessment, such as multiple-choice questions or an essay. The assessment should provide feedback on my performance and identify any knowledge gaps that remain between my current understanding and my learning goals.
