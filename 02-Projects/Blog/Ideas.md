To Love is simply reducing the chances of Survival

We are not supposed to have what we have right now

Hypothetically If there are Multiverses we could easily be the worst version

Aren’t we meant to help each other

we still celebrate the same

In modern times , Love is the stupidest thing you can do

What makes old people old

We are building our Empire on weak foundations
