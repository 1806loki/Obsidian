## Resume Bullet Points for FileView

- Engineered an AI-powered analytics platform using LangGraph orchestration, AWS Bedrock Claude, and semantic analysis to translate natural language queries into optimized SQL, achieving 95%+ query cache hit rate and reducing LLM API calls by 60%+ through vector similarity caching

-  Architected a multi-agent system with specialized routing agents (analytics, troubleshooting, notifications) using FastAPI and MongoDB state management, supporting Oracle and MySQL databases with dynamic query generation and iterative refinement (up to 5 iterations) for complex file transfer analytics

- Implemented semantic preprocessing and few-shot learning with OpenSearch vector embeddings to improve SQL generation accuracy, handling complex time-based queries (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns), state filtering, and multi-table joins across enterprise-scale file transfer datasets

-  Developed intelligent query caching with 95% similarity threshold using Bedrock embeddings and vector similarity search, optimizing token usage with 90K token limit management and reducing query execution latency by 40%+ for frequently asked analytics questions

-  Built production-ready observability with Langfuse integration, MongoDB checkpointing for state persistence, and comprehensive error handling across distributed agents, enabling reliable conversation orchestration for enterprise file transfer analytics at scale

-  Implemented prompt decomposition architecture with semantic preprocessing layer that decomposes natural language queries into structured components (filters, grouping, time intervals) before SQL generation, reducing LLM API costs by 30% and improving query accuracy by 10% through focused, task-specific prompts
