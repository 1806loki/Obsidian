**Purpose**: Defines a standard interface for injecting **context** (history, identity, preferences, memory, etc.) into LLMs across tools, apps, and models.

**Current Standing**: Still under active exploration by major players (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Hugely relevant for cross-model interoperability.

>Think: Using GPT-5 inside Notion, then switching to Claude inside Slack—and both _remember your goals, tasks, and style._

**Use Cases**:

- Unified user memory across tools
    
- Shared context between apps and models
    
- Personalization at scale (your AI assistant _really_ knows you)
