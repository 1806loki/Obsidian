### **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)**

**Purpose**: Standardizes how autonomous AI agents communicate, collaborate, and delegate tasks.  

> Think: GPT asks Claude to summarize a paper, Claude pings a coding agent to write a script, then the script pings an API-handling agent—all autonomously.

**Use Cases**:

- Distributed AI workflows (agents specializing in coding, writing, planning, etc.)
    
- Autonomous DevOps (one agent updates code, another tests, another deploys)
    
- Research co-pilots (GPT agents talk to others specialized in biology, math, law)
