Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, proposed that human development occurs in distinct stages during childhood, each with a different focus of the libido. These stages are known as Freud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development.

## Anal Stage

The anal stage occurs from 18 months to 3 years. During this stage, the child learns to control their bowel movements and experiences pleasure from doing so. If a child is not properly toilet trained, they may develop anal fixation or become overly obsessed with cleanliness.

## Phallic Stage

The phallic stage occurs from 3 to 6 years. During this stage, the child becomes aware of their gender identity and experiences the Oedipus or Electra complex. This is when a child develops a sexual attraction to their opposite-sex parent and competes with their same-sex parent. If a child does not successfully navigate this stage, they may develop sexual dysfunction or gender identity issues.

## Latency Stage

The latency stage occurs from 6 to 11 years. During this stage, the child’s sexual impulses are repressed as they focus on developing social and cognitive skills. This stage is important for the child’s overall emotional and psychological development.

## Genital Stage

The genital stage occurs from 11 years to adulthood. During this stage, the individual develops mature sexual relationships based on mutual respect and love. If the individual has not successfully navigated the previous stages, they may experience sexual dysfunction or struggle with intimacy.
